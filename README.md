# Zomato_Data_Analysis
Python and its following libraries are used to analyze Zomato data.

*  Numpy– With Numpy arrays, complex computations are executed quickly, and large calculations are handled efficiently.
*  Matplotlib– It has a wide range of features for creating high-quality plots, charts, histograms, scatter plots, and more.
*  Pandas– The library simplifies the loading of data frames into 2D arrays and provides functions for performing multiple analysis tasks in a single operation.
*  Seaborn– It offers a high-level interface for creating visually appealing and informative statistical graphics. 

To address our analysis, we need to respond to the subsequent inquiries:

1. Do a greater number of restaurants provide online delivery as opposed to offline services?

2. Which types of restaurants are the most favored by the general public?

3. What price range is preferred by couples for their dinner at restaurants?
